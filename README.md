Testing Bell-inequality (from https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-hackathon-korea-22/issues/12#issue-1123892026)

## Abstract
What can be more fascinating than experimental metaphysics? Bell inequalities are at the heart of studying nonlocality.
In QISKIT tutorial, there is 'Local Reality, CHSH inequality' section (https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-demos/chsh.html).
Now, We will try to show more complicated Bell inequalities for entanglement swapping introduced in recent papers(
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04160-4) etc.
